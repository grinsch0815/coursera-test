<div class="row">

 <div class="relative"> <p class="p1" id="chicken">Chicken</p> </div>
  <p class="p2"> some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)

Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.

Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.
